# grok-my-cv
A repo for learning NLP to generate cover letters. 

# Roadmap

A (very) rough roadmap for the steps planned for this project. Most of the early work will be for learning some of the NLP methods. 
1. Do some background reading on NLP/NLTK/Hugging Face.
2. Scrape Cover letters and associated job postings for few-shot learning.
3. Figure out how to use GPT-JB for generating new cover letters.
